- üëã Hi, My full name is Jashan Singh.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in deploying machine learning in automoboble industry.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently machine learning student. 
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate with the company in automobile industry. 
- üì´ The best way to contact with me via email which is 
- Fun Fact : I'm play very well in board games especially in Caromboard. It is a tabletop game in which Four players can participate. The goal in this game to try to knock other players flick discs to the corner of board. At end, the player who have more discs win the game.
- I made two machine learning project in which the one predict the lung cancer and the another predict sales of a car.

 - Individual Project in Machine Learning : I took the dataset from Kaggle from kaggle to predict the lung cancer in new patients. The ML model predict the result in three categories (High, Medium, Low) by analyzing the provided dataset.
- About dataset : The dataset has total 1000 records of different patients and 26 columns which describe the reason of having lung cancer. Some of the column depends on environmental factors  and some on person internal factors. All the information in columns is described in levels i.e. second level air polluion, third level air pollution etc. 
- Splitting : The target variable in this case is 'Level' column. Because I'm predicting lung cancer prediction so it will give result in different levels 'low', 'Medium' and 'High'.
- Which Algorith : I apllied kNN classifier because it is a classification problem and the kNN is used where we want maximum accuracy.
- Result : The Model is predicting the lung cancer in new patients when the random inputs is given to model. 



  - Group Project : In this project, we applied machine learning in aautomobile indusrtry. For this project, we just selected one car and ite one model which is Acura MDX. We are predicting the sales of ACURA MDX model in future based on the data provided to model.  
 - About dataset : For this project, we made the dataset manually and we collected the information about the sales of Acura MDX model on internet. The information that we collected was not in proper structured format then we did some cleaning and made in proper structured format so that the algoritn can predict sales. We have total 203 records of sales of car and we cllected the data from 2005 to 2020. 
 - Splitting : After doing the cleaning, we just have two columns left. The first columns is datetime which shows that car sales in the different year and then the sales of car which is our target variable.
 - Algorithm: We applied the Random forest regreesor because it is a regression problem and it will make several trees and predict the sale by analyzing the every tree.
 - Result: The model is prediction the sales of car in specific year on which we want to predict sales.
