- 👋 Hi, My full name is Jashan Singh.
- 👀 I’m interested in deploying machine learning in automoboble industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently machine learning student. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with the company in automobile industry. 
- 📫 The best way to contact with me via email which is 
- Fun Fact : I'm play very well in board games especially in Caromboard. It is a tabletop game in which Four players can participate. The goal in this game to try to knock other players flick discs to the corner of board. At end, the player who have more discs win the game.
- Individual Project in Machine Learning : I took the dataset from Kaggle from kaggle to predict the lung cancer in new patients. The ML model predict the result in three categories (High, Medium, Low) by analyzing the provided dataset.
- About dataset : The dataset has total 1000 records of different patients and 26 columns which describe the reason of having lung cancer. Some of the column depends on environmental factors  and some on person internal factors. All the information in columns is described in levels i.e. second level air polluion, third level air pollution etc. 
- Splitting : The target variable in this case is 'Level' column. Because I'm predicting lung cancer prediction so it will give result in different levels 'low', 'Medium' and 'High'.
- Which Algorith : I apllied kNN classifier because it is a classification problem and the kNN is used where we want maximum accuracy.
- Result : The Model is predicting the lung cancer in new patients when the random input is given to model.
